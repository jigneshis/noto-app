// Firebase has been removed from this project.
// This file is kept to prevent import errors from other template files
// but does not initialize or export any Firebase services.

// If you were previously using Firebase services like Firestore or Storage,
// you would need to set up an alternative or re-integrate Firebase.

// For example, to use Supabase (which has been added as a dependency):
// import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
// const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL;
// const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;
// export const supabase = supabaseUrl && supabaseAnonKey ? createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey) : null;

// Placeholder export to avoid breaking imports if 'app' was used,
// though it's not a Firebase app instance anymore.
export const app = {};
